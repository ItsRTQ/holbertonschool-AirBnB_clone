# AirBnB Clone - The Console

## Description

This project is the first step towards building our first full web application: an AirBnB clone. This first step is very important because you will use what you build during this project with all other following projects: HTML/CSS templating, SQL, API, front-end integrationâ€¦

The console is a command interpreter designed to manage the AirBnB objects of our project:

- Create a new object (ex: a new User or a new Place)
- Retrieve an object from a file, a database, etc.
- Do operations on objects (count, compute stats, etc.)
- Update attributes of an object
- Destroy an object
